PSWD is a lightweight **command-line password manager** written in Python (Based on Windows and Linux Filesystem).  
It allows you to **add, unlock, get, reset, and list** your stored credentials, all with session-based security.  

Passwords are encrypted using [Fernet (cryptography)](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/) and stored locally.  
Your session automatically expires after inactivity, requiring you to unlock again for safety.

## Features :
- Secure password storage with encryption  
- Session lock system (auto-expires after inactivity)  
- Simple and intuitive CLI commands  
- JSON storage for easy management
